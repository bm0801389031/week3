## first program
1. cockroach and pdf
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

## fourth program
4. return negative

/*
Description:

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to 
make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
